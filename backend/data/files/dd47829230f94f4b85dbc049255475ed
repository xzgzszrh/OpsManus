Question D.2
(a) What do you understand by the term ‘pipelining’ in the context of handling and
arithmetic operations in RISC design strategy? Discuss three of the potential hazards
associated with instruction pipelining and the options for mitigation. [8 Marks]
Pipelining is an important parallel processing concept – arithmetic sub operations or phases
of instruction cycle overlap in execution. It is viewed as the collection of segments through
which binary information flows.
Instruction pipelining:
The four stages in a simple example of an instruction pipeline are:
1. F - fetch. The instruction is fetched into the CPU
2. D - decode. The instruction is decoded. If necessary, the registers are accessed for
operands.
3. E - execute. The instruction is executed.
4. W - write back. The result of the execution is written back i.e. stored.
Issues:
(i) Structural Hazard: hardware cannot support all possible combinations in different pipeline
stages e.g. stage W for i and F for i+3
Effects alleviated by replication of resources, e.g. dual cache, multiple internal buses etc.,
(ii) Data Hazard : when an instruction depends on the results of a previous instruction
Solution to stall pipeline to ensure most recent data is used
e.g. ADD EBX, ECX
SUB EDX, EBX
Cycle: 1 2 3 4 5
ADD F D E W
New EBX cal. Stored here
SUB F D E W
EBX read
(iii) Issues: stall pipeline
Cycle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
ADD F D E W
SUB F ST ST D E W
More sophisticated solution: forwarding – new value of EBX – calculated in cycle 3 but
forwarded to ALU input as an operand for the subsequent operation
Control Hazard - Appearance of jump, branch, subroutine – upsets pipeline - causes the
fetched instructions to be flushed Example: MOV EBX, 0
CMP ECX, 10
BZ Label1
Next Instruction
Solution: CMP ECX, 10
BZ Label1
MOV EBX, 0
Next Instruction
(b) Briefly discuss the functions and types of RAM and ROM memories used in
microprocessors. [6 Marks]
