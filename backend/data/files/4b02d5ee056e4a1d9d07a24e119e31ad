Part D
Question D.1
(a) ABC Home appliances Ltd. is planning to automate their electrical appliance assembly
line. The assembly line must be automated and optimised to real-time in order to
maximise production. Should the decision makers choose general purpose
microprocessors or microcontrollers for this set up? Justify your answer.
[8 Marks]
They must choose microcontrollers (example, PIC) for the above set up. Microcontrollers
employ Harvard architecture. The features include,
• Code and data memory on separate buses, so the operations are more efficient
• Program memory bus is wide enough to fetch complete instruction each cycle
• Instructions and data can be fetched simultaneously
• Next instruction may be fetched at the same time as current one is executed
(pipelining)
All these will enable to efficiently implement the assembly line to give real-time operations.
(b) Discuss the rationale for your answer for the above question based on the following:
i) Draw the architecture of the microprocessor/controller chosen for the system
and discuss its suitability for the application. [9 Marks]
Fig Harvard architecture for microcontrollers
Some discussion around the suitability will incur up to 9 marks.
ii) Suitability of the processor design for the system. [8 Marks]
Harvard architecture uses Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) for its design. The
features are:
• Very few instructions
• Simple operations
• Short (single-byte)
• Most execute in a single clock cycle
• Mainly orthogonal (all registers accessed in the same way)
• Fewer instructions mean instruction set can be learnt very quickly
• Complex tasks need multiple instructions (e.g. multiply)
• Hardware connection based
Some discussion around how these features make it more suitable will incur up to 8 marks.
